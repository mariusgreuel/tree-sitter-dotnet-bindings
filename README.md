# .NET bindings for tree-sitter parsing library

Provides .NET bindings for the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) parsing library.
Also includes the native tree-sitter parsing library and a complete set of native language parsing libraries.

## Key Features

* .NET bindings for the tree-sitter parsing library.
* Includes native libraries for the tree-sitter parsing library and language grammars.
* Supports 28+ language grammars.
* Supports Windows (x86, x64, arm64), Linux (x64, arm64), and macOS (x64, arm64).
* Support for [predicates queries](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/4075).
* Passes the [WebAssembly bindings](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/lib/binding_web) test suite.

## How to Use

Parsing source code:
```csharp
using TreeSitter;

using var language = new Language("JavaScript");
using var parser = new Parser(language);
using var tree = parser.Parse("console.log('Hello World');")!;
Console.WriteLine($"Root node: {tree.RootNode}");
```

Expected output:
```text
Root node: (program (expression_statement (call_expression function: (member_expression object: (identifier) property: (property_identifier)) arguments: (arguments (string (string_fragment))))))
```

Running queries:
```csharp
using TreeSitter;

using var language = new Language("JavaScript");
using var parser = new Parser(language);
using var tree = parser.Parse("function one() { function two() {} }")!;
using var query = new Query(language, "(function_declaration name: (identifier) @fn)");
foreach (var capture in query.Execute(tree.RootNode).Captures)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Found function: {capture.Node.Text}");
}
```

Expected output:
```text
Found function: one
Found function: two
```

## Installation

To install the .NET bindings for tree-sitter, add the NuGet package [TreeSitter.DotNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TreeSitter.DotNet) to your .NET project.

The NuGet package **TreeSitter.DotNet** consists of three components:

1. The tree-sitter .NET bindings (TreeSitter.dll)
1. The native tree-sitter parsing library (tree-sitter.[dll/so])
1. A number of native language parser DLLs (e.g. tree-sitter-c.[dll/so])

The NuGet package includes all DLLs and shared objects for the supported platforms and languages.

## Included runtime libraries

The NuGet package included pre-built native libraries for the following runtime identifier (RIDs):

- win-x86
- win-x64
- win-arm64
- linux-x64
- linux-arm64
- osx-x64
- osx-arm64

## Development

The tree-sitter .NET bindings consists of two projects:

- The tree-sitter .NET bindings
- The native tree-sitter libraries

If you want to build the tree-sitter .NET bindings,
you need to build the native tree-sitter libraries first.

Building the native tree-sitter libraries is currently supported only for Windows x64 and Linux x64.

### Building .NET bindings for Windows

To build the tree-sitter libraries for **Windows**
open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022** and run the following commands:

```cmd
cd tree-sitter-native
msbuild tree-sitter-native.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
cd ..\src
dotnet build TreeSitter.csproj
```

The native tree-sitter libraries will be placed in the folder `/build/runtimes/win-x64/native`
and automatically copied to your .NET `bin` folder when you build `TreeSitter.csproj`.

### Building .NET bindings for Linux

To build the tree-sitter libraries for **Linux**
open a shell and run the following commands:

```bash
cd tree-sitter-native
make
cd ../src
dotnet build TreeSitter.csproj
```

The native tree-sitter libraries will be built in the folder `/build/runtimes/linux-x64/native`
and automatically copied to your .NET `bin` folder when you build `TreeSitter.csproj`.
